-- Ideas for thing --

Okay so... What I need to do is draw the individiual rectangles and create an offset...

Let's say the board is like this (x is alive, o is dead)

[x][o][o]
[x][x][o]
[o][x][x] 

I then want the output to be like...

[Window						  ]
[col-white][col-red][col-red  ]
[col-white][col-white][col-red]
[col-red][col-white][col-white]

Unsure of how to do this I will stop for tonight. 8.3.17.
